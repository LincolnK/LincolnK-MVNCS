This is a custom Facial recognition program made by me. It is still based off of the Video Face Matcher, and they both use the same .graph file
I also included a simple program that will take your picture on the Raspberry Pi Camera. I found that having different aspect ratios of the validated images and the ones coming in though the camera make it harder for the Neural Network to figure out who's face it is.
